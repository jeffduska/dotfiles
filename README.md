# Jeff Duska's dotfiles

These are my dotfile I use for MacOS. 

They are fork of configuration with some modifications. 

They also work with my fork of his [Mac Development Ansible Playbook](https://github.com/geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook), which configures a Mac from scratch using Ansible, and incorporates the installation and updating of a set of dotfiles like this one.
